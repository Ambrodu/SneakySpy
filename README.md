# SneakySpy 🕵️‍♂️
A program that allows you to set up a trap on your computer. If someone try to move your mouse, it will lock your screen and notify you on discord.

## How it work...

Once running, if the software detects mouse movement, a 15 seconds timer will start. You will have 15 seconds to disable the software before it send the notification and lock the screen.

To exit the software, double click on the tray icon. One clic will open the pass window. I might change this since that mean you only have to double clic on the tray icon to exit the software.

**Only work on Windows!**
